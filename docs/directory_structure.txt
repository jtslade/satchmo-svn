Directory Structure
===================

Before proceeding too far with the Satchmo installation process, it is
useful to get a basic understanding of the way Satchmo is laid out.

The base Satchmo directory should look like this::

    docs
    satchmo
     |
     ---- apps
     ---- projects
     ---- static
     
The docs directory should be self explanatory. 

Satchmo Apps
------------

The core Satchmo application is included in the apps directory and is laid out like this::

    apps
     |
     ---- keyedcache
     ---- l10n
     ---- livesettings
     ---- payment
     ---- product
     ---- satchmo_ext
     ---- satchmo_store
     ---- satchmo_utils
     ---- shipping
     ---- tax

The directories are created in this fashion so that we can accomplish a couple of goals:

    1. Decouple portions of Satchmo so that others may use and improve upon them
    2. Bundle the required portions together so that installation is as simple as possible
    3. Allow store owners flexibility in installing only the portions they need
    4. Allow developers to extend Satchmo to provide the custom portions they require
    
Here's a brief description of the various applications.

    **keyedcache (required)**
        A specialized cache used in various places in Satchmo to speed up and
        improve the overall useability of the application.
        
    **l10n (required)**
        A collection of models and data used to Internationalize Satchmo. This data
        includes all of the country information as well as tools to present information
        correctly depending on the user's location.
        
    **livesettings (required)**
        A sophisticated configuration tool that allows us to set reasonable defaults
        for an application but offer users a streamlined way of changing them through
        the admin interface.
        
    **payment (required)**
        The various payment modules, forms and views used to allow checking out of a store.

    **satchmo_ext (optional)**
        A collection of Satchmo modules that provide optional features that may or may not 
        be needed for your store. Additional information on these are described below.
        
    **satchmo_store (required)**
        The core models, views and urls used for a store. This application includes account
        information, contact information and the base tools for running a store.
        
    **satchmo_utils (required)**
        A collection of helper utilities used throughout Satchmo.
        
    **shipping (required)**
        The various modules used to determine shipping costs for orders.
        
    **tax (optional)**
        Modules for calculating tax based on various criteria.
    
    
Satchmo_ext
+++++++++++

As described above, the satchmo_ext module includes many smaller applications that you
may wish to include in your site.

    **brand**
        This application is useful if you have different brands of products that you want to use to 
        categorize and display your products.
        
    **contrib**
        This application contains one small helper function that modifies the price 
        calculation to count all items in the cart when figuring quantity discounts.
    
    **metrics**
        The metrics app has a Log Middleware which you can add to your middleware and capture
        items that are being viewed.
    
    **newsletter**
        Satchmo has two basic options for handling newsletter configurations. You can use a simple 
        database list or interface with mailman. See :ref:`newsletter`.
    
    **product_feeds**
        Provides support for atom or csv feeds of the products in the store. For more info on using
        with Google base, see :ref:`feeds`.

    **recentlist**
        Allows you to display recently viewed products on your site.
    
    **tieredpricing**
        This application provides improved flexibility for charging different prices
        to different customers. It is useful for membership or other tiered price structures.
    
    **upsell**
        Present options to customers to purchase other items based on their current items. See :ref:`upsell`
    
    **wishlist**
        The wishlist allows shoppers to add items from the store to a list that they might
        want to purchase from in the future.

Satchmo Introduction
=====================

History
-------
Like most Open Source projects, Satchmo was started to "scratch an itch."  This
particular itch was to create a framework for developing shopping cart software
using the Django framework.  After a little bit of discussion on the Django list, 
we created our own project in April 2006.

In August 2007, we released the first public release of Satchmo - version 0.5.

Project Mission
---------------
Satchmo's mission is to use Django to create an open source framework for creating 
unique and robust online stores. To provide maximum flexibility, Satchmo is licensed 
under the BSD license.

Current Development Status
--------------------------
With the release of version 0.5, Satchmo entered beta status.  The most recent release is 0.8.1 and
includes many improvements and fixes over 0.7.  All users are encouraged to use this latest version.
All the basic functionalities required to run the store are present.  Many advanced functions are also available.

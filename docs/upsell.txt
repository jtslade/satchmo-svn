Upsell
==========

Allows for easy upselling or cross-selling of a product. Up-selling can imply selling something additional, or selling something that is more profitable or otherwise preferable for the seller instead of the original sale [#]_ .

A practical example would be If you were selling ebooks, you could make a checkbox on the ebook detail page, which would allow your customer to order the companion CD. This is useful as you are able to provide customers with a direct way of purchasing a companion item without the need to search for it.

A short tutorial
----------------

Here is a quick step by step overview for adding and using the upsell application.

	- In your site's ``settings.py`` file, edit the ``INSTALLED_APP`` list to include ``satchmo_ext.upsell``. Run a syncdb on your site to ensure that the necessary database tables are created.
	- Log into the your site's admin interface, and add a new product. You will want to add the target product (remember that an upselling item can be a standalone product, as well as a variation of an existing product) and an upsell product. You can read the Products_ page for details on how to do this.
	- From your site's admin main page, navigate to the Upsells section to add/change an upsell.
